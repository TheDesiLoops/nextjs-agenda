Demo of Agenda with Next.js

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

First, run the tasks server:

```bash
npm run dev:tasks
# or
yarn dev:tasks
# or
pnpm dev:tasks
# or
bun dev:tasks
```

Every minute you should see "HelloJob" getting printed in the console.

Open [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) with your browser. You will see the message "Hello World!" in the console, as NextJS server schedules a new job every time the API is called.
